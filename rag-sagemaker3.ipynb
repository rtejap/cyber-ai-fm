ranges\n- Data type mismatch in predicates\n- Properly quoting identifiers\n- Using the correct number of arguments for functions\n- Casting to the correct data type\n- Using the proper columns for joins\n\nIf there are any of the above mistakes, rewrite the query. If there are no mistakes, just reproduce the original query.\n\nOutput the final SQL query only.\n\nSQL Query: \nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\nUsing the query.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n the query.\n the query.\n\n the query.\n the query.\n the query.\n the query.\n the query.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n theQuery\n\n theQuery\n\n\n theQuery\n theQuery\n\n\n\n theQuery\n\n\n the query\n the query\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n the\n the\n the\n the columns the columns the columns the questions\n the questions\n the questions questions\n the questions\n the\n the theName theName theName\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n theName theQuestion\n\n\n the\n the\n the the the the the the the the the the the the the\n theName\n theName\ntime.time.time.time.time.time.date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n theName\n theName\n the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the theName\n\n\ntype\nOrdering theName\n\n\n\n\n theName\n the\n the\n the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n date,date,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the\norder.\norder,order.\n\norder, the the the the the the the the the the order the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the\n the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n the\n the\n the\n\n\n\n\norder\n\n\n\n\n the the the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe the the the the the the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\n\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\n\"\t\"\t\"\t\"Ar\"Ar\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\t\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\" \t\"\t\"\t\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\t\"\n\"\n\n\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\t\" \t \t\t \n  \t     \t\"    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\"\t\" \t\"   \n              \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \"        \"   \n \n                            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n                              \t\"\t\"\t\" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \"\n\" \" \"         \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \"    \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \"   \" \" \"                            \" \"+  \"+ \"+ \"+  Tags-     \n \n\n\n-                          \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" -
