_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE = """Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct {dialect} query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer.\n Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples to obtain, query for at most 5 results using the LIMIT clause as per SQLite. You can order the results to return the most informative data in the database.\nNever query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question. Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.\nPay attention to use date('now') function to get the current date, if the question involves \"today\".
Use the following format:

Question: "Question here"
SQLQuery: "SQL Query to run"
SQLResult: "Result of the SQLQuery"

Only use the following tables:
{table_info}

If someone asks for the art table, they really mean the artworks table.

Only single quotation marks, not double quotation marks in the SQL statement (SQLQuery). Never use " in SQL statement (SQLQuery).

Question: {input}"""
