    "This model supports many parameters while performing inference. They include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **max_length:** Model generates text until the output length (which includes the input context length) reaches `max_length`. If specified, it must be a positive integer.\n",
    "* **max_new_tokens:** Model generates text until the output length (excluding the input context length) reaches `max_new_tokens`. If specified, it must be a positive integer.\n",
    "* **num_beams:** Number of beams used in the greedy search. If specified, it must be integer greater than or equal to `num_return_sequences`.\n",
    "* **no_repeat_ngram_size:** Model ensures that a sequence of words of `no_repeat_ngram_size` is not repeated in the output sequence. If specified, it must be a positive integer greater than 1.\n",
    "* **temperature:** Controls the randomness in the output. Higher temperature results in output sequence with low-probability words and lower temperature results in output sequence with high-probability words. If `temperature` -> 0, it results in greedy decoding. If specified, it must be a positive float.\n",
    "* **early_stopping:** If True, text generation is finished when all beam hypotheses reach the end of sentence token. If specified, it must be boolean.\n",
    "* **do_sample:** If True, sample the next word as per the likelihood. If specified, it must be boolean.\n",
    "* **top_k:** In each step of text generation, sample from only the `top_k` most likely words. If specified, it must be a positive integer.\n",
    "* **top_p:** In each step of text generation, sample from the smallest possible set of words with cumulative probability `top_p`. If specified, it must be a float between 0 and 1.\n",
    "* **return_full_text:** If True, input text will be part of the output generated text. If specified, it must be boolean. The default value for it is False.\n",
    "* **stop**: If specified, it must a list of strings. Text generation stops if any one of the specified strings is generated.\n",
